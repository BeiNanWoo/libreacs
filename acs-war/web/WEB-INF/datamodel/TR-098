This table of Vendor Configuration Files is for information only and does not allow the ACS to operate on these files in any way. Whenever the CPE successfully downloads a configuration file as a result of the Download RPC with the FileType argument of "3 Vendor Configuration File", the CPE MUST update this table. If the name of the file (determined as described in the definition of the Name parameter) differs from that of any existing instance, then the CPE MUST create a new instance to represent this file. If instead, the name of the file is identical to that of an existing instance, then the CPE MUST update the content of the existing instance with the new version, date, and (optionally) description of the file.
.DeviceInfo.VendorConfigFile.{i}.Name	string	64			-	-	1.0	Name of the vendor configuration file. If the CPE is able to obtain the name of the configuration file from the file itself, then the value of this parameter MUST be set to that name. Otherwise, if the CPE can extract the file name from the URL used to download the configuration file, then the value of this parameter MUST be set to that name. Otherwise, the value of this parameter MUST be set to the value of the TargetFileName argument of the Download RPC used to download this configuration file.
.DeviceInfo.VendorConfigFile.{i}.Version	string	16			-	-	1.0	A string identifying the configuration file version currently used in the CPE.

.DeviceConfig.ConfigFile	string	32768			W	-	1.0	A dump of the currently running configuration on the CPE. This parameter enables the ability to backup and restore the last known good state of the CPE. It returns a vendor-specific document that defines the state of the CPE. The document MUST be capable of restoring the CPE’s state when written back to the CPE using SetParameterValues. An alternative to this parameter, e.g. when the configuration file is larger than the parameter size limit, is to use the Upload and Download RPCs with a FileType of "1 Vendor Configuration File".
.ManagementServer.	object				-	-	1.0	This object contains parameters relating to the CPE’s association with an ACS.
.ManagementServer.EnableCWMP	boolean				W	-	1.4	Enables and disables the CPE’s support for CWMP. False means that CWMP support in the CPE is disabled, in which case the device MUST NOT send any Inform messages to the ACS or accept any Connection Request notifications from the ACS. True means that CWMP support on the CPE is enabled. The factory default value MUST be True. The subscriber can re-enable the CPE’s CWMP support either by performing a factory reset or by using a LAN-side protocol to change the value of this parameter back to True.
.ManagementServer.URL	string	256			W	-	1.0	URL, as defined in [8], for the CPE to connect to the ACS using the CPE WAN Management Protocol. This parameter MUST be in the form of a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL [6]. The "host" portion of this URL is used by the CPE for validating the ACS certificate when using SSL or TLS. Note that on a factory reset of the CPE, the value of this parameter might be reset to its factory value. If an ACS modifies the value of this parameter, it SHOULD be prepared to accommodate the situation that the original value is restored as the result of a factory reset.
.ManagementServer.Username	string	256			W	-	1.0	Username used to authenticate the CPE when making a connection to the ACS using the CPE WAN Management Protocol. This username is used only for HTTP-based authentication of the CPE. Note that on a factory reset of the CPE, the value of this parameter might be reset to its factory value.

.ManagementServer.PeriodicInformInterval	unsignedInt		1		W	-	1.0	The duration in seconds of the interval for which the CPE MUST attempt to connect with the ACS and call the Inform method if PeriodicInformEnable is True.
.ManagementServer.PeriodicInformTime	dateTime				W	-	1.0	An absolute time reference in UTC to determine when the CPE will initiate the periodic Inform method calls. Each Inform call MUST occur at this reference time plus or minus an integer multiple of the PeriodicInformInterval. PeriodicInformTime is used only to set the "phase" of the periodic Informs. The actual value of PeriodicInformTime can be arbitrarily far into the past or future. For example, if PeriodicInformInterval is 86400 (a day) and if PeriodicInformTime is set to UTC midnight on some day (in the past, present, or future) then periodic Informs will occur every day at UTC midnight. These MUST begin on the very next midnight, even if PeriodicInformTime refers to a day in the future. The Unknown Time value defined in section 2.2 indicates that no particular time reference is specified. That is, the CPE MAY locally choose the time reference, and needs only to adhere to the specified PeriodicInformInterval. If absolute time is not available to the CPE, its periodic Inform behavior MUST be the same as if the PeriodicInformTime parameter was set to the Unknown Time value.
.ManagementServer.ParameterKey	string	32			-	-	1.0	ParameterKey provides the ACS a reliable and extensible means to track changes made by the ACS. The value of ParameterKey MUST be equal to the value of the ParameterKey argument from the most recent successful SetParameterValues, AddObject, or DeleteObject method call from the ACS. The CPE MUST set ParameterKey to the value specified in the corresponding method arguments if and only if the method completes successfully and no fault response is generated. If a method call does not complete successfully (implying that the changes requested in the method did not take effect), the value of ParameterKey MUST NOT be modified. The CPE MUST only modify the value of ParameterKey as a result of SetParameterValues, AddObject, DeleteObject, or due to a factory reset. On factory reset, the value of ParameterKey MUST be set to empty.
.ManagementServer.ConnectionRequestURL	string	256			-	-	1.0	HTTP URL, as defined in [8], for an ACS to make a Connection Request notification to the CPE.

.ManagementServer.UpgradesManaged	boolean				W	-	1.0	Indicates whether or not the ACS will manage upgrades for the CPE. If True, the CPE SHOULD NOT use other means other than the ACS to seek out available upgrades. If False, the CPE MAY use other means for this purpose. Note that an autonomous upgrade (reported via an "10 AUTONOMOUS TRANSFER COMPLETE" Inform Event code) SHOULD be regarded as a managed upgade if it is performed according to ACS-specified policy.
.ManagementServer.KickURL	string	256			-	-	1.0	Present only for a CPE that supports the Kicked RPC method. LAN-accessible URL, as defined in [8], from which the CPE can be "kicked" to initiate the Kicked RPC method call.

LAN-accessible URL, as defined in [8], to which a web-server associated with the ACS MAY redirect a user’s browser on initiation of a file download to observer the status of the download.
.ManagementServer.DefaultActiveNotificationThrottle	unsignedInt				W	-	1.4	This parameter is used to control throttling of active notifications sent by the CPE to the ACS. It defines the minimum number of seconds that the CPE MUST wait since the end of the last session with the ACS before establishing a new session for the purpose of delivering an active notification. In other words, if CPE needs to establish a new session with the ACS for the sole purpose of delivering an active notification, it MUST delay establishing such a session as needed to ensure that the minimum time since the last session completion has been met. The time is counted since the last successfully completed session, regardless of whether or not it was used for active notifications or other purposes. However, if connection to the ACS is established for purposes other than just delivering active notifications, including for the purpose of retrying a failed session, such connection MUST NOT be delayed based on this parameter value, and the pending active notifications MUST be communicated during that connection. The time of the last session completion does not need to be tracked across reboots.
.ManagementServer.UDPConnectionRequestAddress	string	256			-	-	1.2	Address and port to which an ACS MAY send a UDP Connection Request to the CPE (see Annex G of [2]). This parameter is represented in the form of an Authority element as defined in [8]. The value MUST be in one of the following two forms: host:port host When STUNEnable is True, the "host" and "port" portions of this parameter MUST represent the public address and port corresponding to the NAT binding through which the ACS can send UDP Connection Request messages (once this information is learned by the CPE through the use of STUN). When STUNEnable is False, the "host" and "port" portions of the URL MUST represent the local IP address and port on which the CPE is listening for UDP Connection Request messages. The second form of this parameter MAY be used only if the port value is equal to "80".

.ManagementServer.STUNMaximumKeepAlivePeriod	int		-1		W	-	1.2	If STUN Is enabled, the maximum period, in seconds, that STUN Binding Requests MUST be sent by the CPE for the purpose of maintaining the binding in the Gateway. This applies specifically to Binding Requests sent from the UDP Connection Request address and port. A value of -1 indicates that no maximum period is specified.
.ManagementServer.STUNMinimumKeepAlivePeriod	unsignedInt				W	-	1.2	If STUN Is enabled, the minimum period, in seconds, that STUN Binding Requests can be sent by the CPE for the purpose of maintaining the binding in the Gateway. This limit applies only to Binding Requests sent from the UDP Connection Request address and port, and only those that do not contain the BINDING-CHANGE attribute. This limit does not apply to retransmissions following the procedures defined in [9].
.ManagementServer.NATDetected	boolean				-	-	1.2	When STUN is enabled, this parameter indicates whether or not the CPE has detected address and/or port mapping in use. A True value indicates that the received MAPPEDADDRESS in the most recent Binding Response differs from the CPE’s source address and port. When STUNEnable is False, this value MUST be False.

The CPE MAY reject attempts to delete or modify a dynamic route entry. For each incoming packet, the layer 3 forwarding decision is conceptually made as follows: •     Only table entries with a matching ForwardingPolicy are considered, i.e. those that either do not specify a ForwardingPolicy, or else specify a ForwardingPolicy that matches that of the incoming packet. •     For the remaining table entries, those for which the source address/mask matches are sorted by longest prefix, i.e. with the most specific networks first (an unspecified source address is a wild-card and always matches, with a prefix length of zero). •     For the remaining table entries, those for which the destination address/mask matches are sorted by longest prefix, i.e. with the most specific networks first (an unspecified destination address is a wildcard and always matches, with a prefix length of zero). •     The first of the remaining table entries is applied to the packet.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.Enable	boolean				W	False	1.0	Enables or disables the forwarding entry. On creation, an entry is disabled by default.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.Status	string				-	Disabled	1.0	Enumeration of: "Disabled", "Enabled", "Error" (OPTIONAL). The "Error" value MAY be used by the CPE to indicate a locally defined error condition.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.StaticRoute	boolean				-		1.4	If True, this route is a Static route.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.Type	string				W	Host	1.0	Indicates the type of route. Enumeration of: "Host", "Default", "Network", "Host". This parameter is DEPRECATED because its value could conflict with DestIPAddress and/or DestSubnetMask.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.DestIPAddress	string				W	<Empty>	1.0	Destination address. An empty string or a value of  "0.0.0.0" indicates no destination address is specified. A Forwarding table entry for which DestIPAddress and DestSubnetMask are both empty or "0.0.0.0" is a default route.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.DestSubnetMask	string				W	<Empty>	1.0	Destination subnet mask. An empty string or a value of "0.0.0.0" indicates no destination subnet mask is specified. If a destination subnet mask is specified, the DestSubnetMask is ANDed with the destination address before comparing with the DestIPAddress. Otherwise, the full destination address is used as is. A Forwarding table entry for which DestIPAddress and DestSubnetMask are both empty or "0.0.0.0" is a default route.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.SourceIPAddress	string				W	<Empty>	1.0	Source address. An empty string or a value of "0.0.0.0" indicates no source address is specified.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.SourceSubnetMask	string				W	<Empty>	1.0	Source subnet mask. An empty string or a value of "0.0.0.0" indicates no source subnet mask is specified. If a source subnet mask is specified, the SourceSubnetMask is ANDed with the source address before comparing with the SourceIPAddress. Otherwise, the full source address is used as is.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.ForwardingPolicy	int		-1		W	-1	1.0	Identifier of a set of classes or flows that have the corresponding ForwardingPolicy value as defined in the QueueManagement object. A value of -1 indicates no ForwardingPolicy is specified. If specified, this forwarding entry is to apply only to traffic associated with the specified classes and flows.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.GatewayIPAddress	string				W	<Empty>	1.0	IP address of the gateway. Only one of GatewayIPAddress and Interface SHOULD be configured for a route. If both are configured, GatewayIPAddress and Interface MUST be consistent with each other.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.Interface	string	256			W	-	1.0	Specifies the egress interface associated with this entry. The content is the full hierarchical parameter name of the layer 3 connection object. Example: "InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.2.WANPPPConnection.1". Only one of GatewayIPAddress and Interface SHOULD be configured for a route. If both are configured, GatewayIPAddress and Interface MUST be consistent with each other. For a route that was configured by setting GatewayIPAddress but not Interface, read access to Interface MUST return the full hierarchical parameter name for the route’s egress interface.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.ForwardingMetric	int		-1		W	-1	1.0	Forwarding metric. A value of -1 indicates this metric is not used.
.Layer3Forwarding.Forwarding.{i}.MTU	unsignedInt		1	1540	W	-	1.0	The maximum allowed size of an Ethernet frame for this route.
.Layer2Bridging.	object				-	-	1.1	Layer 2 bridging configuration. Specifies bridges between layer 2 LAN and/or WAN interfaces. Bridges can be defined to include layer 2 filter criteria to selectively bridge traffic between interfaces. This object can be used to configure both 802.1D [13] and 802.1Q [14] bridges. Not all 802.1D and 802.1Q features are modeled, and some additional features not present in either 802.1D or 802.1Q are modeled. If the Layer2Bridging object is implemented, the view that it provides of the CPE’s underlying bridging configuration MUST be consistent with the view provided by any LANDevice and WAN**Connection objects. The implications of this are explained in Annex A.6.
.Layer2Bridging.MaxBridgeEntries	unsignedInt				-	-	1.1	The maximum number of entries available in the Bridge table.
.Layer2Bridging.MaxDBridgeEntries	unsignedInt				-	-	1.4	The maximum number of 802.1D [13] entries available in the Bridge table. A positive value for this parameter implies support for 802.1D. There is no guarantee that this many 802.1D Bridges can be configured. For example, the CPE might not be able simultaneously to support both 802.1D and 802.1Q Bridges.
.Layer2Bridging.MaxQBridgeEntries	unsignedInt				-	-	1.4	The maximum number of 802.1Q [14] entries available in the Bridge table. A positive value for this parameter implies support for 802.1Q. There is no guarantee that this many 802.1Q Bridges can be configured. For example, the CPE might not be able simultaneously to support both 802.1D and 802.1Q Bridges.
.Layer2Bridging.MaxVLANEntries	unsignedInt				-	-	1.4	The maximum number of 802.1Q [14] VLANs supported per Bridge table entry.

.Layer2Bridging.MarkingNumberOfEntries	unsignedInt				-	-	1.1	Number of entries in the Marking table.
.Layer2Bridging.AvailableInterfaceNumberOfEntries	unsignedInt				-	-	1.1	Number of entries in the AvailableInterface table.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.	object				W	-	1.1	Bridge table. Each entry in this table represents a single physical 802.1D [13] or 802.1Q [14] bridge. If the Bridge Port table is supported, it explicitly defines the Bridge’s interfaces. Otherwise, they are implicitly defined via the union of the FilterInterface / MarkingInterface parameters for all the Filter and Marking table entries that are associated with the Bridge.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.BridgeKey	unsignedInt				-	-	1.1	Unique key for each Bridge table entry.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.BridgeStandard	boolean				W	"802.1D"	1.4	Selects the standard supported by this Bridge table entry. Enumeration of: "802.1D" ([13]) "802.1Q" ([14])

.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.VLANID	unsignedInt		0	4094	W	-	1.1	For an 802.1D [13] Bridge, which has no concept of VLANs, the value of this parameter MUST be 0. For an 802.1Q [14] Bridge, this is the Bridge’s default VLAN ID, i.e. the VLAN ID that applies to Filter table entries with VLANIDFilter=-1. For an 802.1Q Bridge, the value of this parameter MUST NOT be 0.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.PortNumberOfEntries	unsignedInt				-	0	1.4	Number of entries in the Bridge Port table.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.VLANNumberOfEntries	unsignedInt				-	0	1.4	Number of entries in the Bridge VLAN table.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.Port.{i}.	object				W	-	1.4	Bridge Port table. If this table is supported, it MUST contain an entry for each Bridge Port.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.Port.{i}.PortEnable	boolean				W	False	1.4	Enables or disables this Bridge Port table entry.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.Port.{i}.PortInterface	string	16			W	<Empty>	1.4	The interface associated with this Bridge Port table entry. Represents a bridge port as defined in 802.1D [13] and 802.1Q [14]. To associate this Bridge Port with an interface listed in the AvailableInterface table, the PortInterface value is set to the value of the corresponding AvailableInterfaceKey.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.Port.{i}.PortState	string				-	"Disabled"	1.4	Bridge Port state as defined in 802.1D [13] and 802.1Q [14]. Enumeration of: "Disabled" "Blocking" "Listening" "Learning" "Forwarding" "Broken"
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.Port.{i}.PVID	int		1	4094	W	1	1.4	Default Port VLAN ID as defined in 802.1Q [14]. For an 802.1D [13] Bridge, this parameter MUST be ignored.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.Port.{i}.AcceptableFrameTypes	string				W	"AdmitAll"	1.4	Bridge Port acceptable frame types as defined in 802.1Q [14]. Enumeration of: "AdmitAll" "AdmitOnlyVLANTagged" (OPTIONAL) "AdmitOnlyPrioUntagged" (OPTIONAL) For an 802.1D [13] Bridge, the value of this parameter MUST be "AdmitAll".
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.Port.{i}.IngressFiltering	boolean				W	False	1.4	Enables or disables Ingress Filtering as defined in 802.1Q [14]. For an 802.1D [13] Bridge, the value of this parameter MUST be False.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.VLAN.{i}.	object				W	-	1.4	Bridge VLAN table. If this table is supported, if MUST contain an entry for each VLAN known to the Bridge. This table only applies to an 802.1Q [14] Bridge.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.VLAN.{i}.VLANEnable	boolean				W	False	1.4	Enables or disables this VLAN table entry.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.VLAN.{i}.VLANName	string	64			W	<Empty>	1.4	Human-readable name for this VLAN table entry.
.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.VLAN.{i}.VLANID	int		1	4094	W	-	1.4	VLAN ID of the entry,
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.	object				W	-	1.1	Filter table containing filter entries each of which is associated with one Bridge as specified by a Bridge table entry. For both 802.1D [13] and 802.1Q [14] Bridges, this table is used for the following: 1. If the Bridge Port table is not supported, it implicitly specifies the Bridge interfaces (in collaboration with the Marking table). 2. It specifies destination MAC address classification rules. For an 802.1Q Bridge, this table is also used for the following: 1. For each VLAN ID, it specifies the interfaces that are in the VLAN’s Member Set. 2. If the Bridge Port table is not supported, it specifies the Port VLAN ID (PVID) for each interface. This table also supports several concepts that are not covered by either 802.1D or 802.1Q: 1. It allows a given packet to be admitted to multiple Bridges. 2. It supports Ethertype and source MAC address classification rules.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.FilterKey	unsignedInt				-	-	1.1	Unique key for each Filter table entry.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.FilterEnable	boolean				W	False	1.1	Enables or disables this Filter table entry.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.FilterStatus	string				-	"Disabled"	1.1	The status of this Filter table entry. Enumeration of: "Disabled" "Enabled" "Error" (OPTIONAL) The "Error" value MAY be used by the CPE to indicate a locally defined error condition. If the Bridge Port table is supported, but none of its entries correspond to FilterInterface, or if such an entry exists but is disabled, FilterStatus MUST NOT indicate Enabled. If the Bridge VLAN table is supported, but none of its entries correspond to VLANIDFilter, or if such an entry exists but is disabled, FilterStatus MUST NOT indicate Enabled.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.FilterBridgeReference	int		-1		W	-1	1.1	The BridgeKey value of the Bridge table entry associated with this Filter. A value of -1 indicates the Filter table entry is not associated with a Bridge (and has no effect).
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.ExclusivityOrder	unsignedInt				W	-	1.1	Whether or not the Filter definition is exclusive of all others. And if the entry is exclusive, order of precedence. A value of 1 or greater indicates an Exclusive Filter, where the value 1 indicates the first entry to be considered (highest precedence). A value of 0 indicates a Non-Exclusive Filter (OPTIONAL). For each packet, if the packet matches any Exclusive Filters, the packet is assigned to the Bridge associated with the highest precedence Exclusive Filter to which it matches (lowest ExclusivityOrder value). If and only if the packet does not match any Exclusive Filters, the packet is assigned to all Bridges associated with each Non-Exclusive Filter for which it matches the defining criteria. If a packet matches no Filter, it is discarded. When the ExclusivityOrder is set to match that of an existing Exclusive Filter (1 or greater), the value for the existing entry and all higher numbered entries is incremented (lowered in precedence) to ensure uniqueness of this value. A deletion or change in ExclusivityOrder of an Exclusive Filter causes ExclusivityOrder values of other Exclusive Filters (values 1 or greater) to be compacted. Note that the use of Exclusive Filters to associate a layer 3 router interface with LAN and/or WAN interfaces via a Bridge entry overrides and updates the association between layer 3 and layer 2 objects implied by the InternetGatewayDevice object hierarchy. Support for Non-Exclusive Filter entries, i.e. entries with an ExclusivityOrder value of 0, is OPTIONAL because 802.1D [13] and 802.1Q [14] do not consider the case of a packet potentially being admitted to more than one bridge.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.FilterInterface	string	16			W	<Empty>	1.1	The interface or interfaces associated with this Filter table entry. The bridge corresponding to this Filter table entry is defined to admit packets on ingress to the bridge from the specified interfaces that meet all of the criteria specified in the Filter table entry. The following values are defined. To associate this Filter with a single interface listed in the AvailableInterface table, the FilterInterface value is set to the value of the corresponding AvailableInterfaceKey. "AllInterfaces" indicates that this Filter is associated with all LAN and WAN interfaces listed in the AvailableInterface table (all entries of InterfaceType LANInterface or WANInterface). This value is DEPRECATED because of the configuration complexity it requires. "LANInterfaces" indicates that this Filter is associated with all LAN interfaces listed in the AvailableInterface table (all entries of InterfaceType LANInterface). This value is DEPRECATED because of the configuration complexity it requires. "WANInterfaces" indicates that this Filter is associated with all WAN interfaces listed in the AvailableInterface table (all entries of InterfaceType WANInterface). This value is DEPRECATED because of the configuration complexity it requires. An empty string indicates the Filter table entry is not associated with any interface (and has no effect)
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.VLANIDFilter	int		-1	4094	W	-1	1.1	The 802.1Q [14] VLAN ID associated with this Filter table entry. A value of -1 indicates that the default VLAN ID for the Bridge MUST be used instead (as specified by InternetGatewayDevice.Layer2Bridging.Bridge.{i}.VLANID for the Bridge table entry associated with this Filter table entry). For an 802.1Q bridge, the value of this parameter MUST NOT be 0, and it is interpreted as follows (more than one condition can apply, e.g. a single Filter table entry might both add an interface to a VLAN’s Member Set, and define a classification rule). 1. If the Bridge Port table is not supported, it is a candidate to be the 802.1Q Port VLAN ID (PVID) for the interface associated with this Filter. Where there is more than one such candidate for a given interface, the PVID MUST be selected according to the ExclusivityOrder precedence rules. 2. The interface associated with this Filter is added to the VLAN’s 802.1Q Member Set. 3. If a classification parameter, e.g. DestMACAddressFilterList, is specified, a classification rule for this VLAN ID is added. For an 802.1D [13] Bridge, which has no concept of VLANs, the VLAN ID MUST be 0. This is most easily achieved by allowing this parameter to retain its default value of -1 and relying on the fact that the default VLAN ID for an 802.1D bridge will always be 0.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.AdmitOnlyVLANTagged	boolean				W	False	1.1	802.1Q [14] Acceptable Frame Types criterion. This parameter is DEPRECATED, because it only partly models 802.1Q Acceptable Frame Types (and Ingress Filtering). The Bridge Port table SHOULD be used instead and, if supported, MUST take precedence over this parameter. If True, the Bridge admits only packets tagged with VLAN IDs that include the ingress interface in their 802.1Q Member Sets. If False, the Bridge admits both packets tagged with VLAN IDs that include the ingress interface in their 802.1Q Member Sets, and any Untagged or PriorityOnly packets. All Untagged or PriorityOnly packets are associated on ingress with the interface’s Port VLAN ID (PVID). See the description of VLANIDFilter for an explanation of how the Member Set and PVID are determined. If more than one Filter table entry is associated with a given interface, the value of AdmitOnlyVLANTagged MUST be the same for all such entries. For an 802.1D [13] Bridge, which has no concept of VLANs, the value of this parameter MUST be False.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.EthertypeFilterList	string	256			W	<Empty>	1.1	Classification criterion. Comma-separated list of unsigned integers, each representing an Ethertype value. Note that neither 802.1D [13] nor 802.1Q [14] support classification based on Ethertype.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.EthertypeFilterExclude	boolean				W	True	1.1	If False, on ingress to the interfaces associated with this Filter, the Bridge is defined to admit only those packets that match one of the EthertypeFilterList entries (in either the Ethernet or SNAP Type header). If the EthertypeFilterList is empty, no packets are admitted. If True, on ingress to the interfaces associated with this Filter, the Bridge is defined to admit all packets except those packets that match one of the EthertypeFilterList entries (in either the Ethernet or SNAP Type header). If the EthertypeFilterList is empty, packets are admitted regardless of Ethertype. Note that neither 802.1D [13] nor 802.1Q [14] support classification based on Ethertype.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.SourceMACAddressFilterList	string	512			W	<Empty>	1.1	Classification criterion. Comma-separated list of MAC Addresses. Each list entry MAY optionally specify a bit-mask, where matching of a packet’s MAC address is only to be done for bit positions set to one in the mask. If no mask is specified, all bits of the MAC Address are to be used for matching. For example, the list might be: "01:02:03:04:05:06, 1:22:33:00:00:00/FF:FF:FF:00:00:00, 88:77:66:55:44:33" Note that neither 802.1D [13] nor 802.1Q [14] support classification based on source MAC address.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.SourceMACAddressFilterExclude	boolean				W	True	1.1	If False, on ingress to the interfaces associated with this Filter, the Bridge admits only those packets whose source MAC Address matches one of the SourceMACAddressFilterList entries. If the SourceMACAddressFilterList is empty, no packets are admitted. If True, on ingress to the interfaces associated with this Filter, the Bridge admits all packets except those packets whose source MAC Address matches one of the SourceMACAddressFilterList entries. If the SourceMACAddressFilterList is empty, packets are admitted regardless of MAC address. Note that neither 802.1D [13] nor 802.1Q [14] support classification based on source MAC address.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.DestMACAddressFilterList	string	512			W	<Empty>	1.1	Classification criterion. Comma-separated list of MAC Addresses. Each list entry MAY optionally specify a bit-mask, where matching of a packet’s MAC address is only to be done for bit positions set to one in the mask. If no mask is specified, all bits of the MAC Address are to be used for matching. For example, the list might be: "01:02:03:04:05:06, 1:22:33:00:00:00/FF:FF:FF:00:00:00, 88:77:66:55:44:33"
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.DestMACAddressFilterExclude	boolean				W	True	1.1	If False, on ingress to the interfaces associated with this Filter, the Bridge admits only those packets whose destination MAC Address matches one of the DestMACAddressFilterList entries. If the DestMACAddressFilterList is empty, no packets are admitted. If True, on ingress to the interfaces associated with this Filter, the Bridge admits all packets except those packets whose destination MAC Address matches one of the DestMACAddressFilterList entries. If the WANSourceMACAddressFilterList is empty, packets are admitted regardless of MAC address.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.SourceMACFromVendorClassIDFilter	string	256			W	<Empty>	1.1	Classification criterion. A string used to identify one or more devices via DHCP for which MAC address filtering would subsequently apply. A device is considered matching if its DHCP Vendor Class Identifier (Option 60 as defined in RFC 2132 [28]) in the most recent DHCP lease acquisition or renewal matches the specified value according to the match criterion in SourceMACFromVendorClassIDMode. Case sensitive. Note that neither 802.1D [13] nor 802.1Q [14] support classification based on source MAC address.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.SourceMACFromVendorClassIDFilterExclude	boolean				W	True	1.1	If False, on ingress to the interfaces associated with this Filter, the Bridge admits only those packets whose source MAC Address matches that of a LAN device previously identified as described in SourceMACFromVendorClassIDFilter. If SourceMACFromVendorClassIDFilter is empty, no packets are admitted. If True, on ingress to the interfaces associated with this Filter, the Bridge admits all packets except those packets whose source MAC Address matches that of a LAN device previously identified as described in SourceMACFromVendorClassIDFilter. If the SourceMACFromVendorClassIDFilter is empty, packets are admitted regardless of MAC address. Note that neither 802.1D [13] nor 802.1Q [14] support classification based on source MAC address.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.SourceMACFromVendorClassIDMode	string				W	"Exact"	1.4	SourceMACFromVendorClassIDFilter pattern match criterion. Enumeration of: "Exact" "Prefix" "Suffix" "Substring" For example, if SourceMACFromVendorClassIDFilter is "Example" then an Option 60 value of "Example device" will match with SourceMACFromVendorClassIDMode values of "Prefix" or "Substring", but not with "Exact" or "Suffix". Note that neither 802.1D [13] nor 802.1Q [14] support classification based on source MAC address.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.DestMACFromVendorClassIDFilter	string	256			W	<Empty>	1.1	Classification criterion. A string used to identify one or more devices via DHCP for which MAC address filtering would subsequently apply. A device is considered matching if its DHCP Vendor Class Identifier (Option 60 as defined in RFC 2132 [28]) in the most recent DHCP lease acquisition or renewal matches the specified value according to the match criterion in DestMACFromVendorClassIDMode. Case sensitive.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.DestMACFromVendorClassIDFilterExclude	boolean				W	True	1.1	If False, on ingress to the interfaces associated with this Filter, the Bridge admits only those packets whose destination MAC Address matches that of a LAN device previously identified as described in DestMACFromVendorClassIDFilter. If DestMACFromVendorClassIDFilter is empty, no packets are admitted. If True, on ingress to the interfaces associated with this Filter, the Bridge admits all packets except those packets whose destination MAC Address matches that of a LAN device previously identified as described in DestMACFromVendorClassIDFilter. If the DestMACFromVendorClassIDFilter is empty, packets are admitted regardless of MAC address.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.DestMACFromVendorClassIDMode	string				W	"Exact"	1.4	DestMACFromVendorClassIDFilter pattern match criterion. Enumeration of: "Exact" "Prefix" "Suffix" "Substring" For example, if DestMACFromVendorClassIDFilter is "Example" then an Option 60 value of "Example device" will match with DestMACFromVendorClassIDMode values of "Prefix" or "Substring", but not with "Exact" or "Suffix".
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.SourceMACFromClientIDFilter	string	256			W	<Empty>	1.1	Classification criterion. A string used to identify one or more devices via DHCP for which MAC address filtering would subsequently apply. A device is considered matching if its DHCP Client Identifier (Option 61 as defined in RFC 2132 [28]) in the most recent DHCP lease acquisition or renewal was equal to the specified value. The option value is binary, so an exact match is REQUIRED. Note that neither 802.1D [13] nor 802.1Q [14] support classification based on source MAC address.

The option value is binary, so an exact match is REQUIRED.
.Layer2Bridging.Filter.{i}.DestMACFromClientIDFilterExclude	boolean				W	True	1.1	If False, on ingress to the interfaces associated with this Filter, the Bridge admits only those packets whose destination MAC Address matches that of a LAN device previously identified as described in DestMACFromClientIDFilter. If DestMACFromClientIDFilter is empty, no packets are admitted. If True, on ingress to the interfaces associated with this Filter, the Bridge admits all packets except those packets whose destination MAC Address matches that of a LAN device previously identified as described in DestMACFromClientIDFilter.

.Layer2Bridging.Marking.{i}.	object				W	-	1.1	Marking table identifying non-default layer 2 marking behavior for packets on egress from the specified interfaces. This table is not relevant to 802.1D [13] Bridges, which are not VLAN-aware. For 802.1Q [14] Bridges, this table is used for the following: 1. It specifies whether VLAN tags are to be removed on egress. This table also supports several concepts that are not covered by 802.1Q: 1. It allows the VLAN ID to be changed on egress. 2. It allows the Ethernet Priority to be changed on egress.
.Layer2Bridging.Marking.{i}.MarkingKey	unsignedInt				-	-	1.1	Unique key for each Marking table entry.
.Layer2Bridging.Marking.{i}.MarkingEnable	boolean				W	False	1.1	Enables or disables this Marking table entry.

Enumeration of: "Disabled" "Enabled" "Error" (OPTIONAL) The "Error" value MAY be used by the CPE to indicate a locally defined error condition. If the Bridge Port table is supported, but none of its entries correspond to MarkingInterface, or if such an entry exists but is disabled, MarkingStatus MUST NOT indicate Enabled.
.Layer2Bridging.Marking.{i}.MarkingBridgeReference	int		-1		W	-1	1.1	The BridgeKey value of the Bridge table entry associated with this Marking table entry. A value of -1 indicates the Marking table entry is not associated with a Bridge (and has no effect). The effect of a Marking table entry applies only to packets that have been admitted to the specified bridge (regardless of the ingress interface).
.Layer2Bridging.Marking.{i}.MarkingInterface	string	16			W	<Empty>	1.1	The interface or interfaces associated with this Marking table entry for which the specified marking behavior is to apply on egress from the associated bridge. The following values are defined. To associate this Marking table entry with a single interface listed in the AvailableInterface table, the MarkingInterface value is set to the value of the corresponding AvailableInterfaceKey. "AllInterfaces" indicates that this Marking table entry is associated with all LAN and WAN interfaces listed in the AvailableInterface table (all entries of InterfaceType LANInterface or WANInterface). This value is DEPRECATED because of the configuration complexity it requires. "LANInterfaces" indicates that this Marking table entry is associated with all LAN interfaces listed in the AvailableInterface table (all entries of InterfaceType LANInterface). This value is DEPRECATED because of the configuration complexity it requires. "WANInterfaces" indicates that this Marking table entry is associated with all WAN interfaces listed in the AvailableInterface table (all entries of InterfaceType WANInterface). This value is DEPRECATED because of the configuration complexity it requires. An empty string indicates the Marking table entry table entry is not associated with any interface (and has no effect) If there is more than one enabled Marking table entry that specifies one or more of the same interfaces for the same bridge (identical values of MarkingBridgeReference), then for packets on egress from the specified bridge to those interfaces, the applied marking MUST be that specified in the Marking table entry among those in conflict with the lowest MarkingKey value. If an interface in a given bridge does not have a corresponding Marking table entry, the marking is left unchanged on egress.

A value of -1 indicates that the VLAN ID of the VLAN in which the packet is being bridged is to be used, i.e. no change. The value of this parameter MUST NOT be 0. If VLANIDUntag is True, then no VLAN marking is done since the tag containing the VLAN ID is removed. Note that 802.1Q does not support re-marking on egress.
.Layer2Bridging.Marking.{i}.VLANIDMarkOverride	boolean				W	False	1.4	If False, on egress to the interfaces associated with this Marking table entry, the VLANIDMark, if specified, is applied only to PriorityOnly packets. If True, on egress to the interfaces associated with this Marking table entry, the VLANIDMark, if specified, is to be applied to all packets on this Bridge. If VLANIDUntag is True, then no VLAN marking is done since the tag containing the VLAN ID is removed. Note that 802.1Q [14] does not support re-marking on egress.

When such an interface is modeled in more than one place within the data model, the value of this parameter MUST be a comma-separated list of the full hierarchical parameter names of all of the corresponding objects. For example, if a given Ethernet interface is present within two LANDevice instances, the value of this parameter might be: "InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.1.LANEthernetInterfaceConfig.1,InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.2.LANEthernetInterfaceConfig.1" Note that the remainder of the parameter description does not refer to the possibility that the parameter value is a comma-separated list. Nevertheless, the above requirement does apply. For a WAN interface, this parameter is the full hierarchical parameter name of a particular WANConnectionDevice. A WANConnectionDevice is considered available (included in this table) only if it supports layer 2 bridged traffic. That is, this table MUST include only WANConnectionDevices that contain either a WANEthernetLinkConfig object, or that contain a WANDSLLinkConfig object for which the LinkType is "EoA". For example: "InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.2" For a LAN interface, this parameter is the full hierarchical parameter name of a particular LAN**InterfaceConfig object, or a WLANConfiguration object. This table SHOULD include one entry for each such object. For example: "InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.1.LANEthernetInterfaceConfig.2" For a WAN-side connection to the Gateway’s IP router, this parameter is the full hierarchical parameter name of a particular WAN**Connection service. This table SHOULD include an entry for each layer 3 WAN connection. For example: "InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.2.WANPPPConnection.1" For a LAN-side connection to the Gateway’s IP router, this parameter is the full hierarchical parameter name of a particular LANDevice. This table SHOULD include an entry for each LANDevice, each of which is associated with a LAN-side layer 3 connection to the Gateway’s IP router. For example: "InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.2"

For each packet, the highest ordered entry that matches the classification criteria is applied. All lower order entries are ignored. When this value is modified, if the value matches that of an existing entry, the Order value for the existing entry and all lower Order entries is incremented (lowered in precedence) to ensure uniqueness of this value. A deletion causes Order values to be compacted. When a value is changed, incrementing occurs before compaction.

If this list is empty then traffic can be sent to this queue only as a result of a direct reference from a Classification, App or Flow table entry, e.g. via the Classification table’s ClassQueue parameter. If this list is non-empty then traffic can additionally be sent to this queue if a Classification, App or Flow table entry specifies a traffic class, e.g. via the Classification table’s TrafficClass parameter. If more than one queue on a given egress interface is associated with a given traffic class, the implementation will choose which queue to send traffic of this class to.

This parameter MUST be in one of the following forms: The full hierarchical parameter name of the particular WANDevice, WANConnectionDevice, WAN**Connection, LANDevice, LAN**InterfaceConfig, or WLANConfiguration object. The string "WAN", which indicates this entry applies to all WAN interfaces. The string "LAN", which indicates this entry applies to all LAN interfaces. An empty value, which indicates this classification entry is to apply to all interfaces. Packets classified into this queue that exit through any other interface MUST instead use the default queuing behavior specified in the Queue table entry referenced by InternetGatewayDevice.QueueManagement.DefaultQueue. For the default queue itself (the Queue table entry referenced by InternetGatewayDevice.QueueManagement.DefaultQueue), the value of the QueueInterface parameter MUST be ignored. That is, the default queue MUST exist on all egress interfaces.

.QueueManagement.Queue.{i}.QueuePrecedence	unsignedInt		1		W	1	1.1	Precedence of this queue relative to others. Lower numbers imply greater precedence.
.QueueManagement.Queue.{i}.REDThreshold	unsignedInt		0	100	W	0	1.1	Random Early Detection threshold, used only when DropAlgorithm is RED. This is the minimum threshold (min_th) and is measured as a percentage of the queue size. If the value is set to zero, the CPE MUST choose a sensible value, e.g. 5 (but the value MUST still read back as zero). In this version of the data model, there is no way to set the maximum threshold (max_th). The CPE MUST choose a sensible value, e.g. three times the minimum threshold. In this version of the data model, there is no way to set the RED weight (w_q). The CPE MUST choose a sensible value, e.g. 0.002.

.QueueManagement.Queue.{i}.ShapingRate	int		-1		W	-1	1.1	Rate to shape this queue’s traffic to. For leaky bucket (constant rate shaping), this is the constant rate. For token bucket (variable rate shaping), this is the average rate. If <= 100, in percent of the rate of the highest rateconstrained layer over which the packet will travel on egress. If > 100, in bits per second. A value of -1 indicates no shaping. For example, for packets destined for a WAN DSL interface, if the egress will be on a PPP or IP link with a specified ShapingRate, the percentage is calculated relative to this rate. Otherwise, if the ATM layer is rate-constrained, then the rate is calculated relative to this rate. Otherwise, the rate is calculated relative to the physical-layer DSL rate.
.QueueManagement.Queue.{i}.ShapingBurstSize	unsignedInt				W	-	1.1	Burst size in bytes. For both leaky bucket (constant rate shaping) and token bucket (variable rate shaping) this is the bucket size and is therefore the maximum burst size.

However, this parameter MUST NOT be used to set the user password if the parameter InternetGatewayDevice.UserInterface.PasswordUserSelectable is True. When read, this parameter returns an empty string, regardless of the actual value.

.IPPingDiagnostics.DiagnosticsState	string				W	-	1.0	Indicates availability of diagnostic data. One of: "None" "Requested" "Complete" "Error_CannotResolveHostName" "Error_Internal" "Error_Other" If the ACS sets the value of this parameter to Requested, the CPE MUST initiate the corresponding diagnostic test. When writing, the only allowed value is Requested. To ensure the use of the proper test parameters (the writable parameters in this object), the test parameters MUST be set either prior to or at the same time as (in the same SetParameterValues) setting the DiagnosticsState to Requested. When requested, the CPE SHOULD wait until after completion of the communication session with the ACS before starting the diagnostic. When the test is completed, the value of this parameter MUST be either Complete (if the test completed successfully), or one of the Error values listed above. If the value of this parameter is anything other than Complete, the values of the results parameters for this test are indeterminate. When the diagnostic initiated by the ACS is completed (successfully or not), the CPE MUST establish a new connection to the ACS to allow the ACS to view the results, indicating the Event code "8 DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE" in the Inform message. After the diagnostic is complete, the value of all result parameters (all read-only parameters in this object) MUST be retained by the CPE until either this diagnostic is run again, or the CPE reboots. After a reboot, if the CPE has not retained the result parameters from the most recent test, it MUST set the value of this parameter to "None". Modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the value of this parameter being set to "None". While the test is in progress, modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the test being terminated and the value of this parameter being set to "None". While the test is in progress, setting this parameter to Requested (and possibly modifying other writable parameters in this object) MUST result in the test being terminated and then restarted using the current values of the test parameters.

This identifies the source IP address to use when performing the test. The content is the full hierarchical parameter name of the interface. The following is a WAN interface example: "InternetGatewayDevice.WANDevice.1.WANConnectionDevice.2.WANPPPConnection.1" The following is a LAN interface example: "InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.1.LANHostConfigManagement.IPInterface.1" The value of this parameter MUST be either a valid interface or an empty string. An attempt to set this parameter to a different value MUST be rejected as an invalid parameter value. If an empty string is specified, the CPE MUST use the interface as directed by its routing policy (Forwarding table entries) to determine the appropriate interface.

One of: "None" "Requested" "Complete" "Error_CannotResolveHostName" "Error_MaxHopCountExceeded" If the ACS sets the value of this parameter to Requested, the CPE MUST initiate the corresponding diagnostic test. When writing, the only allowed value is Requested. To ensure the use of the proper test parameters (the writable parameters in this object), the test parameters MUST be set either prior to or at the same time as (in the same SetParameterValues) setting the DiagnosticsState to Requested. When requested, the CPE SHOULD wait until after completion of the communication session with the ACS before starting the diagnostic. When the diagnostic initiated by the ACS is completed (successfully or not), the CPE MUST establish a new connection to the ACS to allow the ACS to view the results, indicating the Event code "8 DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE" in the Inform message.

If Passthrough, and PassthroughMACAddress is empty, the configured values of the MinAddress, MaxAddress, SubnetMask and DNSServers parameters are ignored. The corresponding address pool values are instead taken from the WAN connection specified by AssociatedConnection. If Passthrough, and PassthroughMACAddress is non-empty, the LAN Host identified by PassthroughMACAddress is given a WAN IP address from the WAN connection specified by AssociatedConnection. Other LAN Hosts are treated as for Normal. Use of PassthroughMACAddress does not cover the case where more than one LAN Host is to be given a WAN IP address. This can be achieved by using a DHCP conditional serving pool.

.LANDevice.{i}.LANHostConfigManagement.DHCPStaticAddress.{i}.	object				W	-	1.4	DHCP static address table.  Entries in this table correspond to what RFC 2131 [27] calls "manual allocation", where a client's IP address is assigned by the network administrator, and DHCP is used simply to convey the assigned address to the client. Each instance of this object specifies a hardware address (MAC address) and an IP address within the pool. When serving from this pool, this IP address MUST, if available, be assigned to the DHCP client with this hardware address, and MUST NOT be assigned to any other client. Note that it is possible that an IP address in this table is present in one or more of the conditional serving pools, in which case it is possible that such an address will be assigned to a different client.
.LANDevice.{i}.LANHostConfigManagement.DHCPStaticAddress.{i}.Enable	boolean				W	False	1.4	Enables or disables the DHCPStaticAddress table entry. Disabling an entry does not return the IP address to the pool.

.LANDevice.{i}.LANHostConfigManagement.DHCPConditionalServingPool.{i}.	object				W	-	1.4	DHCP conditional serving pool table.  Each instance of this object defines a DHCP conditional serving pool. Client requests are associated with pools based on criteria such as source interface, supplied DHCP options, and MAC address. If a DHCP request does not match any of the DHCP conditional serving pool entries, the handling of the request is determined by the default DHCP server behavior that is defined by the LANHostConfigManagement object. Overlapping pool ranges MUST be supported.

A value of 1 indicates the first entry considered. For each DHCP request, the highest ordered entry that matches the association criteria is applied. All lower order entries are ignored. When this value is modified, if the value matches that of an existing entry, the Order value for the existing entry and all lower Order entries is incremented (lowered in precedence) to ensure uniqueness of this value. A deletion causes Order values to be compacted. When a value is changed, incrementing occurs before compaction. The value on creation of a DHCPConditionalServingPool table entry MUST be one greater than the largest current value.

Note – This object was originally created to allow WANConnection devices and services to be added dynamically in the IGD object model in TR-064 because UPnP Device Architecture 1.0 did not contain this capability natively. Because in TR-069 objects can be created and removed using the AddObject and DeleteObject RPCs, WANConnection interfaces can be managed using these TR-069 mechanisms directly. Therefore, unlike the TR-064 equivalent, the ConnectionService table within this object is ReadOnly in the TR-069 InternetGatewayDevice data model context. This object is OBSOLETED because it serves no purpose.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANDSLConnectionManagement.ConnectionServiceNumberOfEntries	unsignedInt				-	-	1.0	Number of table entries in the ConnectionService table.

.WANDevice.{i}.WANDSLDiagnostics.LoopDiagnosticsState	string				W	-	1.0	Indicates availability of diagnostic data. One of: "None" "Requested" "Complete" "Error_Internal" "Error_Other" If the ACS sets the value of this parameter to Requested, the CPE MUST initiate the corresponding diagnostic test, which brings down the DSL connection while the test is operating. When writing, the only allowed value is Requested. When requested, the CPE SHOULD wait until after completion of the communication session with the ACS before starting the diagnostic. When the test is completed, the value of this parameter MUST be either Complete (if the test completed successfully), or one of the Error values listed above. If the value of this parameter is anything other than Complete, the values of the results parameters for this test are indeterminate. When the diagnostic initiated by the ACS is completed, the CPE MUST establish a new connection to the ACS to allow the ACS to view the results, indicating the corresponding reason in the Inform message. After the diagnostic is complete, the value of all result parameters (all read-only parameters in this object instance) MUST be retained by the CPE until either this diagnostic is run again, or the CPE reboots. After a reboot, if the CPE has not retained the result parameters from the most recent test, it MUST set the value of this parameter to "None".

After a reboot, if the CPE has not retained the result parameters from the most recent test, it MUST set the value of this parameter to "None". Modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the value of this parameter being set to "None". While the test is in progress, modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the test being terminated and the value of this parameter being set to "None". While the test is in progress, setting this parameter to Requested (and possibly modifying other writable parameters in this object) MUST result in the test being terminated and then restarted using the current values of the test parameters.

The implications of this are explained in Annex A.6.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.Enable	boolean				W	False	1.0	Enables or disables the connection instance. On creation of a WANIPConnection instance, it is initially disabled.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.Reset	boolean				W	False	1.4	When set to True, the device MUST tear down the existing IP connection represented by this object and establish a new one.

.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.AutoDisconnectTime	unsignedInt				W	-	1.0	The time in seconds since the establishment of the connection after which connection termination is automatically initiated by the CPE. This occurs irrespective of whether the connection is being used or not. A value of 0 (zero) indicates that the connection is not to be shut down automatically.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.IdleDisconnectTime	unsignedInt				W	-	1.0	The time in seconds that if the connection remains idle, the CPE automatically terminates the connection. A value of 0 (zero) indicates that the connection is not to be shut down automatically.

.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.ExternalIPAddress	string				W	-	1.0	This is the external IP address used by NAT for this connection. This parameter is configurable only if the AddressingType is Static.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.SubnetMask	string				W	-	1.0	Subnet mask of the WAN interface. This parameter is configurable only if the AddressingType is Static.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.DefaultGateway	string				W	-	1.0	The IP address of the default gateway for this connection. This parameter is configurable only if the AddressingType is Static.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.DNSEnabled	boolean				W	True	1.0	Whether or not the device SHOULD attempt to query a DNS server across this connection.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.DNSOverrideAllowed	boolean				W	False	1.0	Whether or not a manually set, non-empty DNS address can be overridden by a DNS entry received from the WAN.

.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.MACAddressOverride	boolean				W	-	1.0	Whether the value of MACAddress parameter can be overridden. If False, the CPE’s default value is used (or restored if it had previously been overridden).
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.ConnectionTrigger	string				W	"OnDemand"	1.0	Trigger used to establish the IP connection. Enumeration of: "OnDemand" "AlwaysOn" "Manual" The above values are defined as follows: OnDemand: If this IP connection is disconnected for any reason, it is to remain disconnected until the CPE has one or more packets to communicate over this connection, at which time the CPE automatically attempts to reestablish the connection. AlwaysOn: If this IP connection is disconnected for any reason, the CPE automatically attempts to reestablish the connection (and continues to attempt to reestablish the connection as long it remains disconnected). Manual: If this IP connection is disconnected for any reason, it is to remain disconnected until the user of the CPE explicitly instructs the CPE to reestablish the connection. Note that the reason for an IP connection becoming disconnected to begin with might be either external to the CPE, such as non-renewal of a DHCP lease or momentary disconnection of the physical interface, or internal to the CPE, such as use of the IdleDisconnectTime and/or AutoDisconnectTime parameters in this object. Note also that the means by which a CPE would keep an IP connection disconnected (while waiting for the designated trigger) if it is otherwise physically connected and has an IP address is a local matter specific to the implementation of the CPE.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.RouteProtocolRx	string				W	"Off"	1.0	Defines the Rx protocol to be used. Enumeration of: "Off" "RIPv1" (OPTIONAL) "RIPv2" (OPTIONAL) "OSPF" (OPTIONAL)
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.ShapingRate	int		-1		W	-1	1.1	Rate to shape this connection’s egress traffic to. For leaky bucket (constant rate shaping), this is the constant rate. For token bucket (variable rate shaping), this is the average rate. If <= 100, in percent of the rate of the highest rateconstrained layer over which the packet will travel on egress. If > 100, in bits per second. A value of -1 indicates no shaping. For example, for packets destined for a WAN DSL interface, if the ATM layer is rate-constrained, then the rate is calculated relative to this rate. Otherwise, the rate is calculated relative to the physical-layer DSL rate.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.ShapingBurstSize	unsignedInt				W	-	1.1	Burst size in bytes. For both leaky bucket (constant rate shaping) and token bucket (variable rate shaping) this is the bucket size and is therefore the maximum burst size.

.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.DHCPClient.SentDHCPOption.{i}.Enable	boolean				W	False	1.4	Enables or disables this SentDHCPOption table entry.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.DHCPClient.SentDHCPOption.{i}.Tag	unsignedInt		1	254	W	-	1.4	Option tag as defined in RFC 2132 [28].
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.DHCPClient.SentDHCPOption.{i}.Value	base64	340			W	<Empty>	1.4	Base64 encoded option value.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.DHCPClient.ReqDHCPOption.{i}.	object				W	-	1.4	Each instance of this object represents a DHCP option that MUST, if enabled, be requested in DHCP client requests. All requested DHCP options MUST be listed.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.DHCPClient.ReqDHCPOption.{i}.Enable	boolean				W	False	1.4	Enables or disables this ReqDHCPOption table entry.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.DHCPClient.ReqDHCPOption.{i}.Order	unsignedInt		1		W	-	1.4	Position of the option in the DHCP client request. A value of 1 indicates the first entry. When this value is modified, if the value matches that of an existing entry, the Order value for the existing entry and all lower Order entries is incremented to ensure uniqueness of this value. A deletion causes Order values to be compacted. When a value is changed, incrementing occurs before compaction. The value on creation of a ReqDHCPOption table entry MUST be one greater than the largest current value.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.DHCPClient.ReqDHCPOption.{i}.Tag	unsignedInt		1	254	W	-	1.4	Option tag as defined in RFC 2132 [28].
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.DHCPClient.ReqDHCPOption.{i}.Value	base64	340			-	<Empty>	1.4	Base64 encoded most recently received DHCP option value. If no option value has been received, then the value MUST represent an empty string. Received DHCP option values MAY, but need not, persist across CPE reboots.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.	object				W	-	1.0	Port mapping table.  This table MUST contain all NAT port mappings associated with this connection, including static and dynamic port mappings programmatically created via local control protocol, such as UPnP. This table MUST NOT contain dynamic NAT binding entries associated with the normal operation of NAT. At most one entry in an instance of this table can exist with all of the same values for RemoteHost, ExternalPort, and PortMappingProtocol. If the ACS attempts to set the parameters of an existing entry such that this requirement would be violated, the CPE MUST reject the request. In this case, the SetParameterValues response MUST include a SetParameterValuesFault element for each parameter in the corresponding request whose modification would have resulted in such a violation. On creation of a new table entry, the CPE MUST choose default values for ExternalPort and PortMappingProtocol such that the new entry does not conflict with any existing entry.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.PortMappingEnabled	boolean				W	False	1.0	Enables or disables the port mapping instance. On creation, an entry is disabled by default.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.PortMappingLeaseDuration	unsignedInt				W	-	1.0	Determines the time to live, in seconds, of a portmapping lease, where "time to live" means the number of seconds before the port mapping expires. A value of 0 means the port mapping is static. Support for dynamic (non-static) port mappings is OPTIONAL. That is, the only value for PortMappingLeaseDuration that MUST be supported is 0. For a dynamic (non-static) port mapping, when this parameter is read, the value represents the time remaining on the port-mapping lease. That is, for a dynamic port mapping, the value counts down toward 0. When a dynamic port-mapping lease expires, the CPE MUST automatically terminate that port mapping, and MUST automatically delete the corresponding PortMapping table entry.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.RemoteHost	string				W	<Empty>	1.0	This parameter is the IP address of the source of inbound packets. An empty string indicates a ‘wildcard’ (this will be a wildcard in most cases). CPE are REQUIRED only to support wildcards. When RemoteHost is a wildcard, all traffic sent to the ExternalPort on the WAN interface of the gateway is forwarded to the InternalClient on the InternalPort. When RemoteHost is specified as one external IP address, the NAT will only forward inbound packets from this RemoteHost to the InternalClient, all other packets will be dropped. If a CPE supports non-wildcard values for RemoteHost, it MAY additionally support the ability to have more than one port mapping with the same ExternalPort and PortMappingProtocol, but with differing values of RemoteHost. When wildcard values are used for RemoteHost and/or ExternalPort, the following precedence order applies (with the highest precedence listed first): 1. Explicit RemoteHost, explicit ExternalPort 2. Explicit RemoteHost, wildcard ExternalPort 3. Wildcard RemoteHost, explicit ExternalPort 4. Wildcard RemoteHost, wildcard ExternalPort If an incoming packet matches the criteria associated with more than one entry in this table, the CPE MUST apply the port mapping associated with the highest precedence entry. At most one entry in this table can exist with all of the same values for RemoteHost, ExternalPort, and PortMappingProtocol.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.ExternalPort	unsignedInt				W	-	1.0	The external port (or the first port of a range of external ports) that the NAT gateway would listen on for connection requests to a corresponding InternalPort. Inbound packets to this external port on the WAN interface SHOULD be forwarded to InternalClient on the InternalPort. A value of zero (0) represents a ‘wildcard.’ If this value is a wildcard, connection requests on all external ports (that are not otherwise mapped) will be forwarded to InternalClient. In the wildcard case, the value(s) of InternalPort on InternalClient are ignored. When wildcard values are used for RemoteHost and/or ExternalPort, the following precedence order applies (with the highest precedence listed first): 1. Explicit RemoteHost, explicit ExternalPort 2. Explicit RemoteHost, wildcard ExternalPort 3. Wildcard RemoteHost, explicit ExternalPort 4. Wildcard RemoteHost, wildcard ExternalPort If an incoming packet matches the criteria associated with more than one entry in this table, the CPE MUST apply the port mapping associated with the highest precedence entry. At most one entry in this table can exist with all of the same values for RemoteHost, ExternalPort, and PortMappingProtocol.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.ExternalPortEndRange	unsignedInt				W	0	1.4	Indicates the last port of the external port range that starts with ExternalPort. If an external port range is specified, then the behavior described for ExternalPort applies to all ports within the range. A value of zero (0) indicates that no external port range is specified, i.e. that the range consists only of ExternalPort. If ExternalPort is zero (wildcard), the value of this parameter MUST be ignored. If specified, the value of this parameter MUST be greater than or equal to the value of ExternalPort.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.InternalPort	unsignedInt				W	-	1.0	The port on InternalClient that the gateway SHOULD forward connection requests to. A value of zero (0) is not allowed.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.PortMappingProtocol	string				W	-	1.0	The protocol of the port mapping. Enumeration of: "TCP" "UDP" At most one entry in this table can exist with all of the same values for RemoteHost, ExternalPort, and PortMappingProtocol.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.InternalClient	string	256			W	<Empty>	1.0	The IP address or DNS host name of an internal client (on the LAN). Support for an IP address is mandatory. If InternalClient is specified as an IP address and the LAN device’s IP address subsequently changes, the port mapping MUST remain associated with the original IP address. Support for DNS host names is OPTIONAL. If InternalClient is specified as a DNS host name and the LAN device’s IP address subsequently changes, the port mapping MUST remain associated with this LAN device. In this case, it is the responsibility of the CPE to maintain the nameto-address mapping in the event of IP address changes. This can be accomplished, for example, by assigning the DNS host name via use of DHCP option 12 (Host Name) or option 81 (FQDN). Note that the ACS can learn the host name associated with a given LAN device via the Hosts table (InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.{i}.Hosts.). Read access to this parameter MUST always return the exact value that was last set by the ACS. For example, if the internal client is set to a DNS host name, it MUST read back as a DNS host name and not as an IP address. An empty string indicates an unconfigured InternalClient. If this parameter is unconfigured, this port mapping MUST NOT be operational. It MUST be possible to set the InternalClient to the broadcast IP address 255.255.255.255 for UDP mappings. This is to enable multiple NAT clients to use the same well-known port simultaneously.

The value of this counter MAY be reset to zero when the CPE is rebooted.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANIPConnection.{i}.Stats.EthernetDiscardPacketsSent	unsignedInt				-	-	1.4	The total number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted, over all connections within the same WANConnectionDevice that share a common MAC address.

.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.DNSEnabled	boolean				W	True	1.0	Whether or not the device SHOULD attempt to query a DNS server across this connection.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.DNSOverrideAllowed	boolean				W	False	1.0	Whether or not a manually set, non-empty DNS address can be overridden by a DNS entry received from the WAN.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.DNSServers	string	64			W	-	1.0	Comma-separated list of DNS server IP addresses for this connection. Support for more than three DNS Servers is OPTIONAL.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.MACAddress	string				W	-	1.0	The physical address of the WANPPPConnection if applicable. Configurable only if MACAddressOverride is present and True. If TransportType is "PPPoA", the value of this parameter is irrelevant and MUST be an empty string.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.MACAddressOverride	boolean				W	-	1.0	Whether the value of MACAddress parameter can be overridden. If False, the CPE’s default value is used (or restored if it had previously been overridden). If TransportType is "PPPoA", the value of this parameter is irrelevant and MUST be False.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.TransportType	string				-	-	1.0	PPP transport type of the connection. Enumeration of: "PPPoA" "PPPoE" "L2TP" (for future use) "PPTP" (for future use)
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PPPoEACName	string	256			W	<Empty>	1.0	PPPoE Access Concentrator.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PPPoEServiceName	string	256			W	<Empty>	1.0	PPPoE Service Name.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.ConnectionTrigger	string				W	"OnDemand"	1.0	Trigger used to establish the PPP connection. Enumeration of: "OnDemand" "AlwaysOn" "Manual" The above values are defined as follows: OnDemand: If this PPP connection is disconnected for any reason, it is to remain disconnected until the CPE has one or more packets to communicate over this connection, at which time the CPE automatically attempts to reestablish the connection. AlwaysOn: If this PPP connection is disconnected for any reason, the CPE automatically attempts to reestablish the connection (and continues to attempt to reestablish the connection as long it remains disconnected). Manual: If this PPP connection is disconnected for any reason, it is to remain disconnected until the user of the CPE explicitly instructs the CPE to reestablish the connection. Note that the reason for a PPP connection becoming disconnected to begin with might be either external to the CPE, such as termination by the BRAS or momentary disconnection of the physical interface, or internal to the CPE, such as use of the IdleDisconnectTime and/or AutoDisconnectTime parameters in this object.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.RouteProtocolRx	string				W	"Off"	1.0	Defines the Rx protocol to be used. Enumeration of: "Off" "RIPv1" (OPTIONAL) "RIPv2" (OPTIONAL) "OSPF" (OPTIONAL)
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PPPLCPEcho	unsignedInt				-	-	1.0	PPP LCP Echo period in seconds.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PPPLCPEchoRetry	unsignedInt				-	-	1.0	Number of PPP LCP Echo retries within an echo period.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.ShapingRate	int		-1		W	-1	1.1	Rate to shape this connection’s egress traffic to. For leaky bucket (constant rate shaping), this is the constant rate. For token bucket (variable rate shaping), this is the average rate. If <= 100, in percent of the rate of the highest rateconstrained layer over which the packet will travel on egress. If > 100, in bits per second. A value of -1 indicates no shaping. For example, for packets destined for a WAN DSL interface, if the ATM layer is rate-constrained, then the rate is calculated relative to this rate. Otherwise, the rate is calculated relative to the physical-layer DSL rate.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.ShapingBurstSize	unsignedInt				W	-	1.1	Burst size in bytes. For both leaky bucket (constant rate shaping) and token bucket (variable rate shaping) this is the bucket size and is therefore the maximum burst size.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PortMappingNumberOfEntries	unsignedInt				-	-	1.0	Total number of port mapping entries.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.	object				W	-	1.0	Port mapping table. This table MUST contain all NAT port mappings  associated with this connection, including static and dynamic port mappings programmatically created via local control protocol, such as UPnP. This table MUST NOT contain dynamic NAT binding entries associated with the normal operation of NAT. At most one entry in an instance of this table can exist with all of the same values for RemoteHost, ExternalPort, and PortMappingProtocol. If the ACS attempts to set the parameters of an existing entry such that this requirement would be violated, the CPE MUST reject the request. In this case, the SetParameterValues response MUST include a SetParameterValuesFault element for each parameter in the corresponding request whose modification would have resulted in such a violation. On creation of a new table entry, the CPE MUST choose default values for ExternalPort and PortMappingProtocol such that the new entry does not conflict with any existing entry.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.PortMappingEnabled	boolean				W	False	1.0	Enables or disables the port mapping instance. On creation, an entry is disabled by default.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.PortMappingLeaseDuration	unsignedInt				W	-	1.0	Determines the time to live, in seconds, of a portmapping lease, where "time to live" means the number of seconds before the port mapping expires. A value of 0 means the port mapping is static. Support for dynamic (non-static) port mappings is OPTIONAL. That is, the only value for PortMappingLeaseDuration that MUST be supported is 0. For a dynamic (non-static) port mapping, when this parameter is read, the value represents the time remaining on the port-mapping lease. That is, for a dynamic port mapping, the value counts down toward 0. When a dynamic port-mapping lease expires, the CPE MUST automatically terminate that port mapping, and MUST automatically delete the corresponding PortMapping table entry.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.RemoteHost	string				W	<Empty>	1.0	This parameter is the IP address of the source of inbound packets. An empty string indicates a ‘wildcard’ (this will be a wildcard in most cases). CPE are REQUIRED only to support wildcards. When RemoteHost is a wildcard, all traffic sent to the ExternalPort on the WAN interface of the gateway is forwarded to the InternalClient on the InternalPort. When RemoteHost is specified as one external IP address, the NAT will only forward inbound packets from this RemoteHost to the InternalClient, all other packets will be dropped. If a CPE supports non-wildcard values for RemoteHost, it MAY additionally support the ability to have more than one port mapping with the same ExternalPort and PortMappingProtocol, but with differing values of RemoteHost. When wildcard values are used for RemoteHost and/or ExternalPort, the following precedence order applies (with the highest precedence listed first): 1. Explicit RemoteHost, explicit ExternalPort 2. Explicit RemoteHost, wildcard ExternalPort 3. Wildcard RemoteHost, explicit ExternalPort 4. Wildcard RemoteHost, wildcard ExternalPort If an incoming packet matches the criteria associated with more than one entry in this table, the CPE MUST apply the port mapping associated with the highest precedence entry. At most one entry in this table can exist with all of the same values for RemoteHost, ExternalPort, and PortMappingProtocol.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.ExternalPort	unsignedInt				W	-	1.0	The external port (or the first port of a range of external ports) that the NAT gateway would listen on for connection requests to a corresponding InternalPort. Inbound packets to this external port on the WAN interface SHOULD be forwarded to InternalClient on the InternalPort. A value of zero (0) represents a ‘wildcard.’ If this value is a wildcard, connection request on all external ports (that are not otherwise mapped) will be forwarded to InternalClient. In the wildcard case, the value(s) of InternalPort on InternalClient are ignored. When wildcard values are used for RemoteHost and/or ExternalPort, the following precedence order applies (with the highest precedence listed first): 1. Explicit RemoteHost, explicit ExternalPort 2. Explicit RemoteHost, wildcard ExternalPort 3. Wildcard RemoteHost, explicit ExternalPort 4. Wildcard RemoteHost, wildcard ExternalPort If an incoming packet matches the criteria associated with more than one entry in this table, the CPE MUST apply the port mapping associated with the highest precedence entry. At most one entry in this table can exist with all of the same values for RemoteHost, ExternalPort, and PortMappingProtocol.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.ExternalPortEndRange	unsignedInt				W	0	1.4	Indicates the last port of the external port range that starts with ExternalPort. If an external port range is specified, then the behavior described for ExternalPort applies to all ports within the range. A value of zero (0) indicates that no external port range is specified, i.e. that the range consists only of ExternalPort. If ExternalPort is zero (wildcard), the value of this parameter MUST be ignored. If specified, the value of this parameter MUST be greater than or equal to the value of ExternalPort.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.InternalPort	unsignedInt				W	-	1.0	The port on InternalClient that the gateway SHOULD forward connection requests to. A value of zero (0) is not allowed.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.PortMappingProtocol	string				W	-	1.0	The protocol of the port mapping. Enumeration of: "TCP" "UDP" At most one entry in this table can exist with all of the same values for RemoteHost, ExternalPort, and PortMappingProtocol.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.InternalClient	string	256			W	<Empty>	1.0	The IP address or DNS host name of an internal client (on the LAN). Support for an IP address is mandatory. If InternalClient is specified as an IP address and the LAN device’s IP address subsequently changes, the port mapping MUST remain associated with the original IP address. Support for DNS host names is OPTIONAL. If InternalClient is specified as a DNS host name and the LAN device’s IP address subsequently changes, the port mapping MUST remain associated with this LAN device. In this case, it is the responsibility of the CPE to maintain the nameto-address mapping in the event of IP address changes. This can be accomplished, for example, by assigning the DNS host name via use of DHCP option 12 (Host Name) or option 81 (FQDN). Note that the ACS can learn the host name associated with a given LAN device via the Hosts table (InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.{i}.Hosts.). Read access to this parameter MUST always return the exact value that was last set by the ACS. For example, if the internal client is set to a DNS host name, it MUST read back as a DNS host name and not as an IP address. An empty string indicates an unconfigured InternalClient. If this parameter is unconfigured, this port mapping MUST NOT be operational. It MUST be possible to set the InternalClient to the broadcast IP address 255.255.255.255 for UDP mappings. This is to enable multiple NAT clients to use the same well-known port simultaneously.
.WANDevice.{i}.WANConnectionDevice.{i}.WANPPPConnection.{i}.PortMapping.{i}.PortMappingDescription	string	256			W	<Empty>	1.0	User-readable description of this port mapping.
