This table of Vendor Configuration Files is for information only and does not allow the ACS to operate on these files in any way.
Whenever the CPE successfully downloads a configuration file as a result of the Download RPC with the FileType argument of ''3 Vendor Configuration File'', the CPE MUST update this table.  If the name of the file (determined as described in the definition of the {{param|Name}} parameter) differs from that of any existing instance, then the CPE MUST create a new instance to represent this file.  If instead, the name of the file is identical to that of an existing instance, then the CPE MUST update the content of the existing instance with the new version, date, and (optionally) description of the file.{{nokeys}}</description>

{{false}} means that CWMP support in the CPE is disabled, in which case the device MUST NOT send any Inform messages to the ACS or accept any Connection Request notifications from the ACS.
{{true}} means that CWMP support on the CPE is enabled.
The subscriber can re-enable the CPE's CWMP support either by performing a factory reset or by using a LAN-side protocol to change the value of this parameter back to {{true}}.</description>

        <description>This parameter is used to control throttling of active notifications sent by the CPE to the ACS.  It defines the minimum number of seconds that the CPE MUST wait since the end of the last session with the ACS before establishing a new session for the purpose of delivering an active notification.
In other words, if CPE needs to establish a new session with the ACS for the sole purpose of delivering an active notification, it MUST delay establishing such a session as needed to ensure that the minimum time since the last session completion has been met.
The time is counted since the last successfully completed session, regardless of whether or not it was used for active notifications or other purposes. However, if connection to the ACS is established for purposes other than just delivering active notifications, including for the purpose of retrying a failed session, such connection MUST NOT be delayed based on this parameter value, and the pending active notifications MUST be communicated during that connection.
The time of the last session completion does not need to be tracked across reboots.</description>

A value of 5 corresponds to the default behavior that is described in {{bibref|TR-069a2}}.
The device MUST use a random value between {{param}}  and ({{param}} * {{param|CWMPRetryIntervalMultiplier}} / 1000) as the first retry wait interval.  Other values in the retry pattern MUST be calculated using this value as a starting point.</description>

This value is expressed in units of 0.001.  Hence the values of the multiplier range between 1.000 and 65.535.
A value of 2000 corresponds to the default behavior that is described in {{bibref|TR-069a2}}.
