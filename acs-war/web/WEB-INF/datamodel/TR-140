.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.Name	string	64			W	<Empty>	1.0	Setting of this variable will add a new folder. The full hierarchical pathname of the folder MUST be specified.\n\nAll folders created on the Logical Volume will appear here, created locally or via AddObject.\n\nThe local directory name will be formatted as a UNIX-style directory name, for example: /home/ftp\n\nThe presence of a trailing `/' character is inconsequential, meaning that /home/ftp/ is the same as /home/ftp.\n\nOnce this instance becomes enabled, this parameter will be immutable for the life of the instance. This parameter acts as the unique identifier for the instance, thus the device MUST NOT allow multiple Folder instances within a LogicalVolume.{i}. to use the same Name.

On creation of a new table entry, the CPE MUST choose an initial value for Alias such that the new entry does not conflict with any existing entries.\n\nAt most one enabled entry in this table can exist with a given value for UserReference.
.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.UserAccess.{i}.Alias	string	64			W	-	1.2	A non-volatile handle used to reference this instance.

.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.UserAccess.{i}.UserReference	string	256			W	<Empty>	1.0	The value MUST be the path name of a row in the UserAccount table. Represents a user that has access to this folder. The instance of UserAccount.{i}. referenced by this parameter MUST exist within the same StorageService instance.
.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.UserAccess.{i}.Permissions	unsignedInt		0	7	W	7	1.0	What permissions the user account has over this LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.. This is an integer value like the xNIX systems use for access permissions, meaning that it is a 3-bit field with the following structure:\n\n100 = read field\n010 = write field\n001 = execute field\n
.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.GroupAccess.{i}.	object				W	-	1.0	This object provides information about each user group configured for access permissions on this folder.\n\nAt most one entry in this table (regardless of whether or not it is enabled) can exist with a given value for Alias. On creation of a new table entry, the CPE MUST choose an initial value for Alias such that the new entry does not conflict with any existing entries.\n\nAt most one enabled entry in this table can exist with a given value for GroupReference.
.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.GroupAccess.{i}.Alias	string	64			W	-	1.2	A non-volatile handle used to reference this instance. Alias provides a mechanism for an ACS to label this instance for future reference.\n\nIf the CPE supports the Alias-based Addressing feature as defined in [Section 3.6.1/TR-069a4] and described in [Appendix II/TR-069a4], the following mandatory constraints MUST be enforced:\n\nIts value MUST NOT be empty.\nIts value MUST start with a letter.\nIf its instance object is created by the CPE, the initial value MUST start with a "cpe-" prefix.\nThe CPE MUST NOT change the parameter value.\n
.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.GroupAccess.{i}.Enable	boolean				W	-	1.1	Enables or disables the entry.\n\nThe factory default value MUST be false.
.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.GroupAccess.{i}.GroupReference	string	256			W	<Empty>	1.0	The value MUST be the path name of a row in the UserGroup table. Represents a user group that is a collection of User Accounts that have access to this folder. The UserGroup.{i}. referenced by this parameter MUST exist within the same StorageService instance.
.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.GroupAccess.{i}.Permissions	unsignedInt		0	7	W	7	1.0	What permissions the group members have over this LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}. instance. This is an integer value like the xNIX systems use for access permissions, meaning that it is a 3-bit field with the following structure:\n\n100 = read field\n010 = write field\n001 = execute field\n
.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.Quota.	object				-	-	1.0	This object allows the configuration of per-folder storage quota management.
.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.Quota.Enable	boolean				W	FALSE	1.0	Enables or disables quota management for this folder.

.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.Quota.ThresholdLimit	unsignedInt				W	0	1.0	This value is specified in MB and controls when ThresholdReached will have its value altered. If the value of UsedSpace plus the value of this parameter is greater than or equal to the value of Capacity then the value of ThresholdReached will be true, otherwise it will be false. Setting the value of this parameter to 0 will disable the Thresholding mechanism.
.Services.StorageService.{i}.LogicalVolume.{i}.Folder.{i}.Quota.ThresholdReached	boolean				-	FALSE	1.0	When ThresholdLimit > 0 and UsedSpace + ThresholdLimit >= Capacity this will be true, else false.
