    Summary:
    This document defines objects for use in CWMP managed devices.  The objects
    may exist at the top level of a hierarchy, or in some cases within an 
    existing object.  The objects are intended for use in all CWMP Root 
    objects. The objects define varying functionality, diagnostics, etc. that 
    are agnostic to the type of device.

                This table contains details of the device's Current Supported Data Model.
                The table MUST describe the device's entire Supported Data Model.  Therefore, if a device's Supported Data Model changes at run-time, entries will need to be added or removed as appropriate.
                Each table entry MUST refer to only a single Root Object or Service Object.  The device MAY choose to use more than one table entry for a given Root Object or Service Object.
                Considering that every device has some form of a data model, this table MUST NOT be empty.

                <description>
                    URL ({{bibref|RFC3986}}) that describes some or all of the device's Current Supported Data Model.
                    The URL MUST reference an XML file which describes the appropriate part of the Supported Data Model.
                    The referenced XML file MUST be compliant with the DT (Device Type) Schema that is described in {{bibref|TR-106a3|Annex B}}, including any additional normative requirements referenced within the Schema.
                    The XML file referenced by this URL MUST NOT change while the CPE is running, and SHOULD NOT change across a CPE reboot.  Note that, if the same XML file is to be used for multiple CPE, this strongly suggests that the XML file referenced by this URL should ''never'' change.
                    The URL MAY permit the XML file to be accessed at run-time, in which case, the XML file MAY be located within the CPE.
                    Behavior in the event of an invalid URL, failure to access the referenced XML file, or an invalid XML file, is implementation-dependent.</description>

            <parameter name="URN" access="readOnly">
                <description>
                    URN ({{bibref|RFC3986}}) that is the value of the spec attribute in the DM (data model) Instance that defines the Root Object or Service Object referenced by this table entry.
                    For example, if this table entry references a DT Instance that refers to the ''Device:1.3'' Root Object, the value of this parameter would be ''urn:broadband-forum-org:tr-157-1-0-0'', because TR-157 defines ''Device:1.3''.  If the DT Instance instead referred to a vendor-specific Root Object, e.g. ''X_EXAMPLE_Device:1.0'' (derived from ''Device:1.3''), the value of this parameter would be something like ''urn:example-com:device-1-0-0''.

            <parameter name="Features" access="readOnly">
                <description>
                    This parameter MUST list exactly the features that are defined using the top-level ''feature'' element in the DT Instance referenced by {{param|URL}}.
                    For example, if the DT instance specified the following:
                    :&lt;feature name="DNSServer"/&gt;
                    :&lt;feature name="Router"/&gt;
                    :&lt;feature name="X_MyDeviceFeature"/&gt;
                    then the value of this parameter might be ''DNSServer,Router,X_MyDeviceFeature''.  The order in which the features are listed is not significant.
