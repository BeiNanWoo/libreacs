For example: .AVStreams.AVStream.2 .AVStreams.AVStream.2,.AVStreams.AVStream.3
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitoring.	object				-	-		Contains statistics relating to the QoS / QoE of Main AV streams. These statistics are broken down into categories, e.g. de-jittering and RTP, and for each category there are two types of statistics: Total statistics, which count the number of occurrences of something. Sample statistics, which are measured over a sample interval, and are made available to the ACS as a list of the most recent n samples. Total statistics are always collected (collection cannot be disabled, but the values can be reset). For Sample statistics, an STB uses a single sample interval and number of samples (n) for all MainStream instances. The sample interval can be aligned with absolute time. When Sample statistics collection is enabled, statistics collection MUST proceed regardless of whether there are any active Main AV streams. For example, when the STB is in Standby mode, there will be no active Main AV streams, but sample intervals will continue to be timed as normal. Refer to section I.3 for non-normative explanation of the operation of the ServiceMonitoring object.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitoring.SampleEnable	boolean				W	-		Enables or disables collection of Sample statistics. When collection of Sample statistics is enabled, any stored samples are discarded, and the first sample interval begins immediately.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitoring.SampleState	string				-	-		"Indicates availability of Sample statistics. Enumeration of:""Disabled""Collection is disabled""Enabled""Collection is enabled""Trigger""Collection is enabled and the ACS should now fetch the collected data The Trigger value is only used for triggering the ACS to fetch the collected data and can only be used when FetchSamples is in the range [1:ReportSamples]. The transition from Enabled ->Trigger ->Enabled MUST be instantaneous and so will result in only a single value change for notification purposes."
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitoring.SampleInterval	unsignedInt		1		W	-		The sample interval in seconds. Each statistic is measured over this sample interval. The STB MAY reject a request to set SampleInterval to less than .Capabilities.-ServiceMonitoring.MinSampleInterval. Sample intervals MUST begin every SampleInterval seconds, with no delay between samples. If SampleInterval is changed while collection of Sample statistics is enabled, any stored samples are discarded, and the first sample interval begins immediately. For example, if ReportSamples is 24 and SampleInterval is 3600 (an hour), the STB can store up to a day’s worth of samples for each statistic.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitoring.ReportSamples	unsignedInt		1		W	-		The number of samples that the STB can store and report for each statistic. The STB MUST permit ReportSamples to be set to at least .Capabilities.ServiceMonitoring.-MaxReportSamples. If ReportSamples is changed while collection of Sample statistics is enabled, the STB will truncate or extend its statistics buffers as appropriate, but statistics collection MUST NOT otherwise be affected. For example, if ReportSamples is 24 and SampleInterval is 3600 (an hour), the STB can store up to a day’s worth of samples for each statistic.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitoring.FetchSamples	unsignedInt				W	-		If collection of Sample statistics is enabled and FetchSamples is in the range [1:Report-Samples] then SampleState MUST transition from Enabled ->Trigger ->Enabled on completion of every FetchSamples sample intervals. Otherwise, this transition MUST NOT occur. For example, if ReportSamples is 25 and FetchSamples is 24, then the STB will store 25 values for each statistic and the above SampleState transition will occur every 24 sample intervals, which means that the ACS could delay for up to two sample intervals before reading the stored values and would still not miss any samples (see also ForceSample).
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitoring.TimeReference	dateTime				W	-		An absolute time reference in UTC to determine when sample intervals will complete. Each sample interval MUST complete at this reference time plus or minus an integer multiple of SampleInterval. This time reference also determines when the SampleState Enabled ->Trigger ->Enabled transitions that are controlled by Fetch-Samples will occur. If collection of Sample statistics is enabled and FetchSamples is in the range [1:ReportSamples] then each such SampleState transition MUST occur at this reference time plus or minus an integer multiple of FetchSamples * SampleInterval (the fetch interval). TimeReference is used only to set the “phase” of the sample and fetch intervals.  The actual value of TimeReference can be arbitrarily far into the past or future. If TimeReference is changed while collection of Sample statistics is enabled, any stored samples are discarded, and the first sample interval begins immediately. The Unknown Time value defined in [2]indicates that no particular time reference is specified. That is, the STB MAY locally choose the time reference, and is required only to adhere to the specified sample and fetch intervals. If absolute time is not available to the STB, its sample and fetch interval behavior MUST be the same as if the TimeReference parameter was set to the Unknown Time value. For example, if SampleInterval is 3600 (an hour) and if TimeReference is set to UTC midnight on some day (in the past, present, or future) then sample intervals will complete on each UTC hour (00:00, 01:00, 02:00 etc). If, in addition, FetchSamples is 24, then the fetch interval is 86400 (a day) and Sample-State Enabled ->Trigger ->Enabled transitions will occur every day at UTC midnight. Note that, if TimeReference is set to a time other than the Unknown Time, the first sample interval (which has to begin immediately) will almost certainly be shorter than SampleInterval).  This is why TimeReference is defined in terms of when sample intervals complete rather than start.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitoring.ForceSample	boolean				W	-		When set to true, forces statistics for the current sample to be calculated and updated in the data model.  Setting it to false has no effect. The value is not saved in device state and is always false when read. If this is the first time that ForceSample has been set to true during the current sample interval, this MUST cause a new value to be added to each of the Sample statistics comma-separated list parameters, and the ReportEndTime and all SampleSeconds parameters MUST be updated accordingly. If this is not the first time that ForceSample has been set to true during the current sample interval, then the new values that were added as described in the previous paragraph, and the ReportEndTime and all SampleSeconds parameters, MUST be updated accordingly. Note that ForceSample just provides a “sneak preview” of the current sample.  It does not create a new sample and it does not interfere with the sample interval schedule. At the end of each sample interval, if ForceSample was set to true during the sample interval then the new values that were added as described above, and the ReportEndTime and all SampleSeconds parameters, will be updated accordingly. In other words, the partial sample data that was created when ForceSample was set to true will be updated one last time at the end of the sample interval.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitoring.ReportStartTime	dateTime				-	-		The absolute time at which the sample interval for the first stored sample (for each statistic) started.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitoring.ReportEndTime	dateTime				-	-		The absolute time at which the sample interval for the last stored sample (for each statistic) ended. If ForceSample has been used to force statistics for the current sample to be calculated and updated in the data model, then ReportEndTime MUST be updated to reflect the actual time over which stored data was collected.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitoring.MainStreamNumberOfEntries	unsignedInt				-	-		Number of MainStream instances.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitor	object				-	-		List of Main AV stream objects. Each instance is associated with a specified service type and will collect statistics only for the main stream that matches that service type. Note that this means that streams that do not match an instance’s service type MUST NOT contribute to the instance’s Total and Sample statistics. It is up to the STB to determine which AV stream should be regarded as the Main AV stream for a given service type at any given time. For example, if two active streams are associated with the same service type, the STB might prefer streams that are associated with an AV player, or if more than one stream is associated with an AV player, the STB might prefer a player that is outputting a DVI stream to a player that is outputting an RF stream. Note that some parameters, e.g. .Components.FrontEnd.{i}.IP.ServiceConnect.URI, include requirements that restrict the STB’s freedom to determine which AV stream should be regarded as the Main AV stream for a given service.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitor.Enable	boolean				W			Enables or disables collection of Total and Sample statistics for this object instance.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitor.Status	string				-			Total and Sample statistics collection status for this object instance. Enumeration of: “Disabled” “Enabled” “Error” (OPTIONAL) The “Error” value MAY be used by the CPE to indicate a locally defined error condition.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitor.ServiceType	string				W			Service type associated with this main stream instance, or an empty string if this instance is disabled. If non-empty, the string MUST be one of the .Capabilities.ServiceMonitoring.ServiceTypes values. The STB MUST reject a request that would result in a given AV stream contributing to more than one ServiceMonitoring MainStream instance, e.g. it would reject a request to enable simultaneous collection of both IPTV and IP statistics, or to collect IPTV statistics on more than one instance.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitor.AVStream	string	256			-	-		Path name of the Main AV stream object instance currently associated with this ServiceMonitoring main stream instance.  The value MUST be a path name, either of the form “.AVStreams.AVStream.{i}” or else a full path name. For example: .AVStreams.AVStream.2 Note that, during the period of time over which Sample statistics are stored, this Service-Monitoring main stream instance might be associated with many different AVStream instances. This parameter just provides information about which AVStream is currently being monitored.
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitor.Gmin	unsignedInt				W	-		Minimum number of consecutive received packets after the end of an RTP Loss Event. A Loss Event is defined as as a sequence of lost packets, possibly including islands of received packets. Each island consists of up to (Gmin – 1) received packets (a sequence of Gmin received packets terminates the Loss Event, and so is not an island).
.Services.STBService.{i}.ServiceMonitor.SevereLossMinDistance	unsignedInt				W	-		The minimum distance required between error events before an RTP Loss Event is considered severe. Used in the calculation of SevereLossIndexCount and SevereLossIndexCountBeforeEC.
