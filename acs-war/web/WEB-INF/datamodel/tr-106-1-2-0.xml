  Summary:
  TR-069 Device:1.2 Root Object errata and clarifications.

  Version History:
  November 2008: tr-106-1-2-0.xml, corresponds to TR-106 Amendment 2 section
                 3.4 (Common Object Definitions), section 3.5 (Inform Require-
                 ments), section 3.6 (Notification Requirements) and section 4
                 (Profile Definitions).  Contains only the differences from
                 Device:1.2 as defined in TR-143.
  September 2009: tr-106-1-2-0.xml (name unchanged)
                 - removed duplicate bibrefs
                 - fixed cwmp-datamodel.xsd to be cwmp-datamodel-1-0.xsd

        <description action="replace">An absolute time reference in UTC to determine when the CPE will initiate the periodic Inform method calls.  Each Inform call MUST occur at this reference time plus or minus an integer multiple of the {{param|PeriodicInformInterval}}.
{{param}} is used only to set the ''phase'' of the periodic Informs.  The actual value of {{param}} can be arbitrarily far into the past or future.
For example, if {{param|PeriodicInformInterval}} is 86400 (a day) and if {{param}} is set to UTC midnight on some day (in the past, present, or future) then periodic Informs will occur every day at UTC midnight.  These MUST begin on the very next midnight, even if {{param}} refers to a day in the future.
The Unknown Time value defined in {{bibref|TR-106a2|section 3.2}} indicates that no particular time reference is specified.  That is, the CPE MAY locally choose the time reference, and needs only to adhere to the specified {{param|PeriodicInformInterval}}.
If absolute time is not available to the CPE, its periodic Inform behavior MUST be the same as if the {{param}} parameter was set to the Unknown Time value.</description>

This parameter is represented in the form of an Authority element as defined in {{bibref|RFC3986}}.  The value MUST be in one of the following two forms:
: host:port
: host
* When {{param|STUNEnable}} is {{true}}, the ''host'' and ''port'' portions of this parameter MUST represent the public address and port corresponding to the NAT binding through which the ACS can send UDP Connection Request messages (once this information is learned by the CPE through the use of STUN).
* When {{param|STUNEnable}} is {{false}}, the ''host'' and ''port'' portions of the URL MUST represent the local IP address and port on which the CPE is listening for UDP Connection Request messages.
The second form of this parameter MAY be used only if the port value is equal to ''80''.</description>

        <description action="replace">Indicate the availability of diagnostic data.  {{enum}}
If the ACS sets the value of this parameter to {{enum|Requested}}, the CPE MUST initiate the corresponding diagnostic test.  When writing, the only allowed value is {{enum|Requested}}.  To ensure the use of the proper test parameters (the writable parameters in this object), the test parameters MUST be set either prior to or at the same time as (in the same SetParameterValues) setting the {{param}} to {{enum|Requested}}.
When requested, the CPE SHOULD wait until after completion of the communication session with the ACS before starting the diagnostic.
When the test is completed, the value of this parameter MUST be either {{enum|Completed}} (if the test completed successfully), or one of the ''Error'' values listed above.
If the value of this parameter is anything other than {{enum|Completed}}, the values of the results parameters for this test are indeterminate.
When the diagnostic initiated by the ACS is completed (successfully or not), the CPE MUST establish a new connection to the ACS to allow the ACS to view the results, indicating the Event code ''8 DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE'' in the Inform message.
After the diagnostic is complete, the value of all result parameters (all read-only parameters in this object) MUST be retained by the CPE until either this diagnostic is run again, or the CPE reboots.  After a reboot, if the CPE has not retained the result parameters from the most recent test, it MUST set the value of this parameter to {{enum|None}}.
Modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.
While the test is in progress, modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the test being terminated and the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.
While the test is in progress, setting this parameter to Requested (and possibly modifying other writable parameters in this object) MUST result in the test being terminated and then restarted using the current values of the test parameters.</description>
