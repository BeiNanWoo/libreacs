Note that this parameter does not have any impact on the number sent in the outgoing request -but is instead only used for searching within the Numbering Plan. This parameter has no effect if it is set to 0. This parameter is provided to handle Carrier override and other codes that may prefix standard numbers and to ensure that the correct""End of Dialing""can be specified without significant data duplication."
